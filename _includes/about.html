                <p>My name is Masami Okada and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer currently based in LÃ¼beck, Germany. Having been born and raised in San Diego, California, I've travelled the world playing football for a living for the past 10 years. I came across programming and web design on my search for an alternate career and since then I've lost myself deep in code. I have begun my education with diverse online courses through FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy and hope to expand my knowledge and skills to set me on my way to become a proficient programmer.</p>
