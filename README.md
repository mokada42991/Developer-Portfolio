Masami Okada Web Developer Portfolio
=============================

A personal portfolio webpage introducing myself as a web developer.

The project is built upon [shakyShane's starter project](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) which sets up Jekyll, GulpJS, SASS, AutoPrefixer &amp; BrowserSync.

I've also incorporated the base CSS from the  [DevTips-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit).
